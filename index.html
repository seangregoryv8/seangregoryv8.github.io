            <h2>Who Am I?</h2>
            <p>
                My name is Sean Gregory. I'm a student at John
                Abbott College, studying in Computer Science.
                While my possible career may lie in computers, that
                is far from all in terms of what I do: Animation,
                Music, Video Editing, Filmmaking, Storytelling,
                I seek to use my extensive skills in the arts in
                what I do in order to show people who I truly am.
            </p>
            <p>
                Born and raised in Montreal Quebec in a quiet town,
                I'm all for the suburban, quiet lifestyle, but because
                I'm an extrovert, I wouldn't mind a bit of chaos in my
                life. My mind is always flowing with ideas, so I could
                probably be seen in a coffee shop (even though I don't
                drink coffee), a park, or just in front of my computer,
                trying to take all the insane ideas from my head and
                find some use for them.

                <p class="AnimationText">
                    This was my final project for my college Animation class, and
                    the start of something amazing for me, as it is my proudest
                    piece of work to date.

                <h2>Filmmaking: Detracted Minds</h2>
                <p class="FilmmakingText">
                    Similar to Animation, I had done 2 semesters of Filmmaking, and this 
                    was my final assignment for Filmmaking 2. With the help of Lucciano Vezina,
                    along with many others, we were able to get together an 8-minute-long short movie
                    that, while it may have its flaws, is still an amazing piece of work for my first
                    attempt at a short movie.

                <p class="ProgrammingText">
                    When I entered into the computer science program, I was asked to make a game for my programming class.
                    Here is a screenshot of what the game looks like in its 'Very Alpha' state. It was great to make and
                    is the most advanced project I have worked on in the Computer Science Program. You can download and
                    play the game by simply clicking on the image.

            <div class="Literature"><h2>Literature: Phantoms In Need</h2>
                <p class="LiteratureText">
                    One of the earliest 'big projects' I have ever done was a massive novella back when I was in grade 11,
                    for a giant school project, that I called 'Phantoms In Need: Apostle of the Dead'. While it doesn't
                    look the best, and may be the weakest of the bunch, literature is what I have spent a long time working
                    on and improving. Just that we all have to start somewhere, and here was my somewhere to start.
