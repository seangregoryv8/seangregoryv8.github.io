                            Inspired by Ori and the Blind Forest, this jump-centered game is, for now, my crowning
                            achievment. Made alongside my friend, Philippe Lizotte, this game has sprites, level design,
                            and general feel that demonstrates my current skill with creating video games.

                            Inspired by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cube_(1997_film)">1997 movie of the same name</a>, this game involves a player entering through
                            different rooms, gathering artifacts, while avoiding the deadly traps that lay ahead.
                            This was my first game ever made using Javascript Canvas, and it turned out rather alright.

                        <p>
                            When I entered into the computer science program, I was asked to make a game for my programming class.
                            Here is a screenshot of what the game looks like in its 'Very Alpha' state. It was great to make and
                            is the most advanced project I have worked on in the Computer Science Program. You can download and
                            play the game by simply clicking on the image.

                            This was my final project for my college Animation class, and
                            the start of something amazing for me, as it is my proudest
                            piece of work to date.

                            Similar to Animation, I had done 2 semesters of Filmmaking, and this 
                            was my final assignment for Filmmaking 2. With the help of Lucciano Vezina,
                            along with many others, we were able to get together an 8-minute-long short movie
                            that, while it may have its flaws, is still an amazing piece of work for my first
                            attempt at a short movie.

                            A more in-depth film project, Panic At Work is a final project for a Job Preparation
                            class about what not to do in the workplace. With the help of Artimes Fallah and
                            starring Carmina-Ioana Rotaru, Palmarinao DiMarco and Kevin Rumboldt,
                            this 24-minute long short film, a much bigger project than the afformentioned, describes
                            my current filmmaking capabilities.
