                    The Legend of Zelda franchise has always changed gaming forever with a lot of its entries: The original title changed
                    2D adventure games forever with its incredible design and gameplay, Ocarina of Time did the same with 3D and is regarded
                    as being one of the greatest video games ever made, Twilight Princess did so much new to the franchise, Wind Waker made an
                    entirely new design work seamlessly with its cartoon asthetic, but Breath of the Wild may very well be the most ground-breaking 
                    entry thus far: a ginormous nation, free for you to explore on your own, so many secrets for you to find without someone
                    pointing them out for you, no clear direction to go to, free for you to play your video game the way you want. With seamlessly
                    amazing weapons, challenging enemy design, and an incredibly beautiful artstyle, it is understandable to nominate this game for
                    a potential game of the decade award. The Switch is already not a powerful console, trading in power for portability, and Breath
                    of the Wild is such a graphically intense game, having to operate and render all of Hyrule at once. While Nintendo is tight-lipped
                    about their development tools used for their games, Breath of the Wild has one of the beefiest design engines I have ever seen to
                    render everything in the game on such a non-graphically intense console as the Switch.

                    There is so much to respect about Elon Musk, both in the world of business and the world of computer science: founding the incredibly
                    successful automobile powerhouse company Tesla, along with the revolutionary SpaceX, it has been thanks to this man for the strides that
                    we as people have taken. As well, this man might be one of the most successful, or at least well-known, American CEOs in history:
                    Selling his company for over $1 billion dollars, founding two of the most successful companies in history, and managing to save those companies
                    when every single card was turned against him: three rocket failures, Martin Eberhard promising unrealistic expectations on Tesla and leaving the
                    company, his wife divorcing him and the market crash of 2008. Even with everything, Elon managed to save both of his companies when he had absolutely
                    nothing to work with. As well, the Falcon models, the design functions of the rockets that SpaceX makes, being that no part of the rocket is wasted,
                    as well as he design of the different cars at Tesla, are what make Elon Musk such a powerhouse in the realm of both computer science and business.

                    With many video games seeming to hold our hands in the modern age, especially after the success of the gimmicky Nintendo Wii, Xbox Kinect,
                    and Playstation Move. It seemed like those, along with the increase of popularity with the mobile gaming industry, video games would become
                    nothing more than casual gimmicks to attract as many people as possible. This is where Dark Souls entered the realm, with its one and only
                    motto: difficulty. Not holding your hand, not guiding you through linear levels, and not letting you have a moment to breathe, it revolutionized
                    gaming forever, with it almost seeming like a right of passage before you could call yourself good at video games, along with harder entries to
                    popular franchises afterwards being dubbed as 'Souls-like' or 'The Dark Souls of ..'. In a similar way that Street Fighter made the fighting game genre,
                    Metal Gear Solid made the stealth game genre, or DOOM made the first person shooter genre, Dark Souls, most notibly the third one with its much harder
                    difficulty and extremely solid story, music, and design, redifined what it truly meant to play a videogame.

                    Valve, being the giant company that they are, need to have a game engine that they use, considering how their games tend to follow
                    each other very closely together from their style. This engine is known as the source engine, and is one of the most well-known
                    video game engines ever, alongside other gems such as OpenGL, HTML5 and even Unity. Source has inspired so many creators with its
                    extensions off of Garry's Mod and Source Filmmaker. As well, it is also well known as being a source engine that can be picked up
                    and easily tweaked, modded, and added onto, with its various forms of addons, dupes, extensions, and mods designed specifically
                    to see just how diverse, powerful, and flexible the source engine really is.
